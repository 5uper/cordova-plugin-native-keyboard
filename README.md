## I wanna try it!
```
$ cordova create nativekeyboardtest
$ cd nativekeyboardtest
$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-nativekeyboard
```

Now copy the contents of [our demo](demo/index.html) over `www/index.html`, and do one of these:

```
$ cordova run ios
$ cordova run android
```

## I like it, hook me up!
This plugin has been a BEAST to implement and its maintenance is killing me already
so I need to make this a commercial offering to keep it afloat. If you have a compelling
reason to not pay for an unlocked version let me know and we'll try to work out something.

* Look up the ID of the app you want to use the plugin with - you can find it at the top of config.xml and is something like `io.cordova.hellocordova`.
* Send $100 to [my PayPal account](https://www.paypal.me/EddyVerbruggen/100usd) and make sure to include your app ID.
* You'll quickly receive a license key (and instructions) which you can use to install the plugin.
